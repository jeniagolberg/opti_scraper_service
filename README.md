# opti_scraper_service

usage : npm install

use /scrape to pass urls and begin crawling over the given links.
    /getMovieData, use this endpoint to get the collected data, since for this version the data is saved locally.

future updates:
    - connect to proper db to save data not locally, thus no need for /getMovieData.
